 <br>I want to publish content that I wrote in markdown. I want very basic styling like you see in Obsidian, Notion or other Editors. What is the best way to self-publish the content?<br>Okay, let's explore the best ways to self-publish your markdown content with basic styling similar to Obsidian or Notion. Here's a breakdown of options, considering ease of use, styling capabilities, and ongoing maintenance:<br>1. Dedicated Markdown Hosting Platforms (Easiest &amp; Recommended for Most Users)<br>
<br>Hypothes.is: This is arguably the best option for replicating the Obsidian experience. It’s built specifically for collaborative note-taking and reading.

<br>Styling: Offers a robust styling system using CSS. You can customize fonts, colors, headings, lists, and more. It’s designed to be highly adaptable.
<br>Features: Supports syncing across devices, collaborative editing, and exporting to various formats (PDF, HTML, etc.).
<br>Cost: Free for personal use; paid plans for teams.
<br>Ease of Use: Very easy to set up and use.


<br>Notion: While primarily a workspace app, Notion handles markdown beautifully.

<br>Styling:  Offers a good level of styling through blocks and formatting options. You can create visually appealing pages.
<br>Features: Excellent for organization, databases, and collaboration.
<br>Cost: Free for personal use; paid plans for teams.
<br>Ease of Use: Relatively easy to learn, especially if you're familiar with other Notion users.


<br>Werkr:  Specifically designed for publishing and sharing markdown.

<br>Styling:  Offers a simple but effective styling system.
<br>Features:  Focuses on creating beautiful, readable documents.
<br>Cost: Free for personal use; paid plans for teams.
<br>Ease of Use: Very straightforward.


<br>2. Static Site Generators (More Technical, Greater Control)<br>
<br>MkDocs: A popular choice for creating documentation websites from markdown.

<br>Styling: Uses CSS for styling. You'll need to learn some CSS basics or find a pre-built theme.
<br>Features: Great for creating structured documentation.
<br>Ease of Use: Requires some technical knowledge (command line, basic HTML/CSS).


<br>Hugo: A very fast static site generator.

<br>Styling: Uses CSS for styling.
<br>Features: Powerful and flexible.
<br>Ease of Use: Steeper learning curve than MkDocs.


<br>3. Simple Hosting with Custom CSS<br>
<br>GitHub Pages: You can host static markdown files directly from a GitHub repository.

<br>Styling: You'll need to add your own CSS to style the pages.
<br>Features: Free hosting.
<br>Ease of Use: Requires some technical knowledge (GitHub, CSS).


<br>Key Considerations &amp; Recommendations:<br>
<br>Styling Complexity: If you want a lot of customization, Hypothes.is or Notion are the easiest choices.  If you're comfortable with CSS, GitHub Pages or a static site generator offer more flexibility.
<br>Collaboration: If you need to collaborate with others, Hypothes.is and Notion are excellent.
<br>Maintenance: Static site generators require more maintenance (updates, theme changes).
<br>To help me narrow down the best recommendation for you, could you tell me:<br>
<br>What is the primary purpose of publishing your content? (e.g., personal notes, documentation, a public website)
<br>How important is collaboration?
<br>What is your level of technical comfort (e.g., comfortable with the command line, familiar with CSS)?
<br>I want to publish my Obsidian md files via. github pages. I dont want to do any styling. How?<br>Okay, let's outline the steps to publish your Obsidian notes via GitHub Pages without any styling. This focuses on getting your content out there simply and effectively.<br>Here’s a breakdown of the process:<br>1. Understanding GitHub Pages and Static Sites<br>
<br>GitHub Pages is a service that allows you to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository.  “Static” means the content is delivered as-is, without any server-side processing or dynamic elements. This is perfect for your Obsidian notes because you want to present them exactly as they are.
<br>2. Preparing Your Obsidian Vault<br>
<br>Folder Structure: Ensure your Obsidian vault is organized in a way that makes sense for your content. While GitHub Pages doesn’t care about the folder structure within your vault, a logical structure within the vault will make it easier to manage your notes.
<br>File Types: GitHub Pages supports common file types like .md (Markdown), .html, .css, .js, .png, .jpg, .gif, etc.  You’re primarily using .md files, so make sure they are properly formatted.
<br>No Styling:  Crucially, do not include any CSS or JavaScript files in your vault.  GitHub Pages will ignore them.  Your goal is a plain, unstyled presentation of your notes.
<br>3. Creating a GitHub Repository<br>
<br>Create a New Repository: Go to GitHub and create a new repository.

<br>Repository Name: Choose a descriptive name for your repository (e.g., my-obsidian-notes).
<br>Public vs. Private:  Make the repository public so that GitHub Pages can access it.
<br>Initialize Repository:  Don’t initialize it with a README file or a .gitignore file.  We’re going to upload your entire vault directly.


<br>4. Uploading Your Obsidian Vault to GitHub<br>
<br>Navigate to Your Repository: Once the repository is created, go to the “code” tab.
<br>Copy the Repository URL: Copy the URL that starts with https://github.com/...
<br>Open Obsidian: In Obsidian, go to File &gt; Link local file.
<br>Paste the URL: Paste the GitHub repository URL into the "Link local file" dialog.
<br>Choose "Link": Select the "Link" option.  Obsidian will now copy your entire vault into the GitHub repository. This process can take a little while depending on the size of your vault.
<br>5. Enabling GitHub Pages<br>
<br>Go to Settings: In your GitHub repository, click on the "Settings" tab.
<br>Navigate to Pages: In the left sidebar, click on "Pages".
<br>Select Source: Choose "GitHub Actions" as the source. This is the simplest method for static sites.
<br>Save: Click "Save".
<br>6.  Deployment<br>
<br>GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy your site.  You'll see a message in the repository indicating that the deployment is in progress.  This can take a few minutes.
<br>Access Your Site: Once the deployment is complete, GitHub will provide a URL for your site. It will look something like https://&lt;your-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;your-repository-name&gt;.  This is the URL where your Obsidian notes will be displayed.
<br>Important Notes:<br>
<br>No Custom Domains: This method doesn’t allow you to use a custom domain name. It uses a GitHub-provided subdomain.
<br>Updates:  When you update your Obsidian notes, the changes will automatically be reflected on the GitHub Pages site because it’s a static site.
<br>Troubleshooting: If you encounter any issues, check the GitHub Pages documentation for troubleshooting tips: <a rel="noopener nofollow" class="external-link" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages" target="_blank">https://docs.github.com/en/pages</a>
<br>Do you want me to elaborate on any specific step, such as troubleshooting or understanding the GitHub Actions deployment process?]]></description><link>y Folder/25-03-27.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">y Folder/25-03-27.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 11:01:29 GMT</pubDate></item><item><title><![CDATA[2]]></title><description><![CDATA[

 <br>Write a poem<br>Okay, here’s a poem for you:<br>The rain falls soft, a silver sheen,<br>
Washing the world, serene and clean.<br>
Each drop a whisper, light and low,<br>
Of secrets that the breezes know.<br>The pavement glistens, dark and deep,<br>
Reflecting skies where shadows sleep.<br>
A quiet solace, cool and bright,<br>
A moment held within the light.<br>The scent of earth, a fragrant plea,<br>
Rising softly, wild and free.<br>
A gentle rhythm, calm and slow,<br>
Inviting peace to overflow. <br>Let worries fade, let tensions cease,<br>
Find comfort in this tranquil peace.<br>
Embrace the stillness, deep and true,<br>
And let the rain renew you.]]></description><link>Note 2.html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Note 2.md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 27 Mar 2025 11:05:54 GMT</pubDate></item></channel></rss>
